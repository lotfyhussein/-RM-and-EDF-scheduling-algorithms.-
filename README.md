# -RM-and-EDF-scheduling-algorithms.-
 a  simulator  for  the  RM  and  EDF  scheduling  algorithms.  The  input  to  the  simulator  is  a  periodic  tasks - set.  Each  task ,  in  the  tasks - set, is  characterized  by  its  period  and  Worst - Case  Execution - Time  ( WCET ) .  The  simulator output i s the processor - task assignments (schedule) over the tasks - set hyper - period.
